Oregon's tax system is the subject of perennial grumbling among Oregonians, but a new national survey gives it high marks for fairness.Washington -- which has high sales taxes and no income taxes -- ranked dead-last in fairness in WalletHub's report.Of course, that doesn't make Oregon's tax system immune to criticism.  Oregon's governors and legislators have frequently sought systemic reforms to reduce the boom-and-bust nature of the state's tax collections and provide more stable funding for schools.  Some critics complain that businesses get too many tax breaks while others say the state's relatively high personal income tax rates discourages business investment.--Jeff Mapesjmapes@oregonian.com503-221-8209@Jeffmapes
