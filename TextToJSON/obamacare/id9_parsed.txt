Pope Francis vs. Obamacare may be one of the biggest rivalries in the Catholic church today. On Wednesday, the pope visited a convent known as the Little Sisters of the Poor, a group currently suing the U.S. government for mandating birth control.Many religious groups consider birth control to be a form of murder, therefore a violation of the Ten Commandments. It is believed that the instant an egg is fertilized in a woman’s body, it is a form of life and precious in the eyes of God.According to Catholic laws, even rape victims must carry the child to term and raise it, wanted or not. Birth control violates this practice, which is believed to be divine and unwavering. Others who don’t agree with the religious law are those who conceive before they are ready to raise a child.The debate has raged ever since birth control became part of the medical industry.Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi has stated that the convent’s visit from Pope Francis means Obamacare is something the religious leader opposes as well.Father Lombardi told a radio station, “This is a sign, obviously of support for them.”Pope Francis’ opposition to Obamacare could make serious waves in the government.
