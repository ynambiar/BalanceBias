Saturday, September 26, 2015The Newnan-Coweta Chamber of commerce hosted a webinar on Tuesday to help business owners understand how the legalization of same-sex marriage might affect their business.The main objective of the presentation was to ensure that businesses updated all their company policies and employee handbooks to indicate that same-sex spouses are considered a spouse. “The best practice to follow is the golden rule,” said Mel Haas, a Macon attorney. “Be sure to treat everyone as you would want to be treated.”Haas, a labor attorney with Constangy, Brooks, Smith, and Prophete, LLP, has been recognized as one of the "Top 20 Most Powerful Labor Attorneys" by Human Resources Executive Magazine, 2012-2015.Haas emphasized that employers should be careful not to discriminate against anyone based on sexual orientation and to respect the beliefs of others.Haas told business owners that although the new law requires all states to issue and honor same-sex marriage licenses, they can still exercise their First Amendment rights to protect their religious freedom and not condone same-sex marriage. Haas warns business owners that denying certain rights based on this could be tricky.“Bottom line is, the First Amendment gives you the right to oppose same-sex marriage on religious grounds,” Haas said. “Just remember that the law is the law and there can be consequences.”The main difference in how the workplace will operate under the same-sex marriage ruling is that same-sex married couples can now get the same benefits as heterosexual couples. This includes time off under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which permits up to 12 weeks off for the birth or adoption of a child, to care for a sick spouse, or if the employee has a serious health condition. Civil unions and domestic partnerships remain unaffected.Haas encourages all employers to make a special notice to same-sex-marriage employees of their rights to enroll for benefits and to keep all paperwork in order to ensure no one is being discriminated against.“Make sure same-sex spouses are treated like any other,” Haas said.Georgia is the 8th highest state in the US with same-sex households.
