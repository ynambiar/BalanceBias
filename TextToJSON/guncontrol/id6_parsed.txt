Boehner didn’t stop there. He added this perspective: “And when people use weapons in a horrible way, we should condemn the actions of the individual, not blame the action on some weapon.“Listen,” he said, “there are hundreds of millions of weapons in America. They’re there. And they’re going to be there. They’re protected under the Second Amendment. But people who use weapons in an inappropriate or illegal way ought to be dealt with severely.”That’s the kind of matter-of-fact logic that the gun prohibition lobby hates. In retrospect, maybe if Boehner had been equally as blunt in all of his dealings with the Obama administration, regardless the subject, things might have been different.Boehner’s announcement has set off a wave of bashing on social media. Facebook, for example, has been loaded with images of the Speaker in tears on various occasions. Many people are not sorry about his announcement, and there’s lots of cheering.“We understand that Mr. Boehner is a very nice person and that is exactly why we make this request,” the petition says. “We need a Leader, not a Friend.”Boehner’s resignation came one day after the unprecedented address to Congress by Pope Francis, during which the speaker wept. Perhaps he figured that nothing could top that, and it was time to leave.------------------------Got an opinion about this column?
