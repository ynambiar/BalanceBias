If this compensation is granted by U.S. District Judge Timothy S. Black -- whose ruling the Supreme Court upheld in deciding the case – it will be a bitter pill for many Ohioans to swallow. But it appears that the law is on the plaintiffs' side.• Talk about the topic of this editorial in the comments below.Attorney Jennifer Branch of the plaintiff's law firm, Gerhardstein & Branch, says that the lawyers worked on contingency, with the expectation that they would recover their fees only if they prevailed, and deserve to be compensated under the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Award Act.Are the attorneys' fees indeed reasonable? Judge Black will decide whether the 3,047 hours the lawyers say they devoted to the case, and the total amount, are excessive. More than half the total hours were billed by three attorneys from the firm at a rate of between $450 and $700 per hour.At the very least, however, the apparent attempt to cash in with the 50 percent bonus seems egregious and well outside the intent of the 1976 law.
